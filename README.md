# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using the Bengaluru House Price dataset. The dataset contains various features related to houses in Bengaluru, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and price. By analyzing this dataset and building a predictive model, we intend to develop a system that can accurately estimate the price of houses in Bengaluru based on their characteristics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bengaluru House Price CSV file. It includes information about houses in Bengaluru, such as their location, size, number of bedrooms, total area, and price. The dataset will serve as the foundation for training and testing our predictive models.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices in Bengaluru based on various features. By leveraging techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, we aim to create a predictive model that can provide valuable insights into the real estate market in Bengaluru.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: We will start by preprocessing the dataset, which may involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Next, we will perform feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the dataset and create new features that may improve the predictive performance of our model.
3. **Model Selection**: We will explore various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to identify the most suitable model for predicting house prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: We will evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Once we have identified the best-performing model, we will fine-tune its hyperparameters to optimize its performance further.
6. **Deployment**: Finally, we will deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data and integrate it into a user-friendly application or service.

## Conclusion
By successfully building and deploying a predictive model for house prices in Bengaluru, we aim to provide valuable insights for homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in solving real-world problems and offers potential avenues for further research and development in the field of real estate analytics.
